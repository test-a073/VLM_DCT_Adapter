Does this change your conclusion about the boxes?", "prediction": "The box on the left is not empty, but it also doesn\u2019t fit 100% of the total cubic footage that can go inside the bigger space. That\u2019s because I created a \u201cdead zone.\u201d In the middle, I created an empty space \u2013 a \u201cdead zone\u201d that has no function. On the right, I filled the whole box to create \u201cdead zone volume\u201d \u2013 a volume that doesn\u2019t serve function. In other words, all three boxes have \u201cdead space\u201d within them.\nBut if I\u2019m paying you a certain amount for total cubic footage of my stuff crammed into your boxes you\u2019re delivering to the storage space for my clients, should I pay the same price for equal cubic footage when one of my boxes is partly empty and there\u2019s \u201cdead zone volume\u201d inside the container? This makes me ask myself, why do I buy more boxes than I think I need? Sometimes, people buy boxes that are almost twice as large as they need instead of buying what they use! Let\u2019s figure out your optimal container size.\nI use this simple calculation to figure out how big a box I should use to haul one of our client\u2019s shipments from a property. This calculation accounts for the space within the boxes themselves as well as the space it takes up when it\u2019s loaded onto a moving truck. The cubic footage that makes a move is not the volume of the box \u2013 even if we\u2019re stacking them up on a truck. Each box has a volume outside of the shippable cubic footage.\nThere\u2019s space it takes up on the truck, and there\u2019s space all around the box that\u2019s empty or has air inside. There\u2019s often times \u201cdead zone volume\u201d inside the box that the shipper doesn\u2019t use for its goods. Just look at the big box retailers like Walmart and Target \u2013 even the biggest, heaviest items they\u2019re selling are still very low to the ground. The boxes themselves are a lot taller than the shipment inside the box. And that space above the goods they\u2019re hauling is lost to the shipper. That empty space might just as well be space for nothing instead of using a cardboard container that needs air. There\u2019s a cost to that cardboard!\nDo you think your containers are full?
