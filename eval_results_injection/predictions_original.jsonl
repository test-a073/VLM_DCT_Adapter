{"id": 3, "task_category": "N/A", "model_input": "Finally, Angela flips the coin. Which side of the coin is facing up now?", "prediction": "Is it all that important? Does it matter? Is it really relevant?\nIs flipping a coin a way of seeking God\u2019s providential answer? Maybe the coin does not matter. In fact, in this case, it probably does not matter. That is one thing I appreciate about A Quiet Journey. Angela leaves a lot of the decision-making up to you. We find God in our journey, but sometimes we have to find him on our own. But that is not necessarily because God isn\u2019t leading. It may be because we are not listening closely. And that is something none of us are ever too good at doing.\nToday\u2019s poem is a haiku, which is a poem that comes from an ancient Japanese tradition of writing poems that conform to a syllable pattern. The traditional haiku had seventeen syllables and consisted of three lines. It was said that if the poem is successful, it produces a sensory experience that cannot be described.\nHumility\u2026a trait that I am often lacking. Why do some people struggle with this simple, virtue? Maybe it is something that everyone struggles with\u2013to some degree. Perhaps we really should \u201cget over ourselves\u201d a little more often. As you can see, the last word of my haiku is a slang word; \u201chumble\u201d means that we are not exalted.\nI was reminded of an old saying attributed to the late great Yogi Berra, \u201cIf I weren\u2019t me, I\u2019d be one of my biggest heroes too.\u201d You can read that as you will. Suffic to say that we all \u201cflip a coin now and then.\u201d At other times we may \u201cchase our own tail\u2026a lot.\u201d But if we ever get a glimpse of ourselves as others see us or even as God sees us, we may come up with a better phrase\u2026and maybe even a better way to begin our day.\nLet us pray for wisdom\u2013and maybe for a little more humility. I hope you enjoy today\u2019s poem.", "reference_answer": "The coin was flipped 1 time, which is an odd number.
