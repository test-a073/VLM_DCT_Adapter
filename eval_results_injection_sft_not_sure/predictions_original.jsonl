Students will develop inquiry skills and practice using evidence to support scientific explanations while answering the questions: What do organisms need to survive? Where do organisms get their energy? What processes and events do organisms participate in that lead to their own growth or demise? In this course, students learn about the structure and function of plants and animals. How does the environment sustain the survival and growth of living organisms? The study of living things leads to a deeper understanding of life processes and the natural world. Scientific explanations for living systems require multiple representations such as diagrams, drawings, models, and simulations. These tools support the inquiry process of scientific practice by enabling exploration and visualization of complex systems. A model is a simplified representation of a system that focuses on important details and omits irrelevant details. Students conduct a science experiment using a model of a food web or model of a simple machine. Students create graphic organizers to organize and illustrate scientific information, such as Venn diagrams, time lines, and webs.

All patients were submitted to chest CT, intraoperative bronchoscopy, mediastinoscopy, and postoperative chest X-ray and were followed up clinically and by chest X-ray every 3 to 6 months for an average of 5 years (range, 3 to 10 years).

Why?\n\nThe FDA is worried about the risk of patients accidentally overdosing on ibuprofen. You may think that taking more ibuprofen than recommended means that you just take extra tablets (or capsules), and you'd be right. However, some medications for ibuprofen are sold in blister packaging with 80mg tablets in a pack that's divided into two.

Most of these overdose incidents involved children younger than 5 years of age who might have accidentally ingested ibuprofen.

Also, I don't own vegetable bouillon cubes (and can't find them), do you have any suggestions for a substitute?\nHi, a couple of suggestions .... I usually put a tablespoon of cornstarch into my roux mixture instead of flour. The results are the same and cornstarch also works better than flour to thicken a sauce. I also suggest that you make your roux in a microwavable measuring cup. This is important. As your roux thickens, you will need to stir your mixture more quickly and more often. The microwavable cup will allow you to do that without burning the roux. When your roux is dark enough, add a quarter cup of vegetable broth (or water if you have no broth), stirring vigorously with a fork. Then, pour your roux mixture into a sauce pan and add 2 tablespoons of vegan soy butter (such as Earth Balance), 2 tablespoons of Nutritional yeast (sometimes called Parmesan Flakes to make it thicker), 1 teaspoon of Dijon Mustard, 1/4 teaspoon of Garlic powder (or finely minced garlic), 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper. To simmer your sauce, bring it to boiling temperature for just a few seconds, then turn down the heat and let it simmer away until it thickens (with continual stirring).

I've been lifting for about twenty years and I still go full bore 7 days a week. I'm in my 50's now and I think it's a little different taking an almost full time job for an extended period of time, but I still like to train on my days off... Sometimes I don't train as hard but I am still in the gym. I was following a high volume lifting plan. 4 days a week, one day was a speed lifting day or a low volume lifting day. I was doing a single set of 20 reps or 30 seconds of max reps. Doing this seemed to be putting a lot of stress on my shoulder and I've been having some shoulder issues. I wanted to drop down to 3 days a week, one of them being speed or low volume and the others high volume with a single set of 10 reps and then a second set at 5 reps.

The president at the start of the Great Depression was Herbert Hoover.\n\nGot it. I didn't even know Franklin D. Roosevelt was president during the Great Depression, but I remember him as the leader who guided the United States through World War II.\nNARRATOR: Yes, that's correct. When FDR became president, in 1933, the Great Depression had been underway for four years.\n\nWow, the depths of the Great Depression must have been staggering around that time. How did people manage to get by, let alone rebuild their lives?\nNARRATOR: That's definitely a difficult question to answer. For many people, it was a major struggle to make ends meet. But there were also some creative solutions that emerged during those years. One of the most important of these was the creation of local work projects that put people back to work during the lean times. These projects were designed to improve local infrastructure and create amenities that the community needed. For example, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) created jobs for millions of Americans during the Great Depression by building, repairing, and upgrading public works such as schools, highways, airports, and bridges. The WPA also sponsored community events, provided food, clothing and medical care, and supported artists and writers \u2013 which produced noteworthy accomplishments during the Depression.\n\nI can see how important the projects funded by the WPA were in keeping people employed and providing essential goods and services. But I'm curious, did people who took advantage of these programs suffer any long-term effects, such as diminished job prospects when the projects ended?\nNARRATOR: That's a good question. The long-term effects of WPA projects were generally positive. Workers who gained experience and skills through WPA projects were better equipped to find work later on. In addition, the projects often inspired community-based initiatives that outlasted the program itself. For example, the WPA provided the framework for many local park and recreational facilities that are still in use today in communities across the country. Furthermore, WPA-paid artists and writers continued to create important works that helped shape American culture and contributed to society in many positive ways.\n\nSo, were there any other significant initiatives or programs that helped", "reference_answer": "The Great Depression began after the stock market crash in October 1929, and Herbert Hoover was the President of the United States at that time.

Maybe it's because I've been busy trying to make sense of my own country's politics, and the way I'm feeling about them.\nBut I was reading The New Yorker and came across one of his poems. I hadn't known that he had written, before and after he became president, all about getting on with politics in a republic. And, of course, as you might expect, it sounds even more contemporary than it is.\nThe poem is 17 lines. Here are the first 12:\nThe eye of the voter is not easy / to displease and to please / But the wise man takes pains / to know at what cost the viceroyalty / of republics may be vindicated / by the sacrifice of the rights of the many / not the whole of the few.\nAnd it goes on from there. What I like is the way it sets one thought about democracy and politics against another (the eye of the voter being a politician or politician's desire) and in the process, exposes a truth that's easy to miss, that a democracy must find a way to balance the interests of the individual, the interests of power (the viceroyalty is how Hamilton made power for himself), and the interests of the community (the rights of the many, though it might seem a more obvious virtue). It's so easy for this to go off course, and all the more reason to remember (as these eight lines will help you do) where it is we have agreed to place our trust.\nIt is something of a national embarrassment that our president seems incapable of this sort of thinking, or perhaps even acknowledging the possibility of more than one perspective on an issue.

The reason that liquid mercury doesn't boil like water is a testament to why I chose to become a chemist. For the simple fact that one of the first things I was taught in my undergraduate chem lab was that the boiling point changed with atmospheric pressure. That's right, the temperature range we're used to on our ovens and stoves was simply a guess of how hot it'll likely get up high in the mountains. But just because I'm able to explain it doesn't mean it's fun (see my previous post). With my research, we were able to identify and characterize the mechanism behind the change in boiling points with temperature.\nFor starters at sea level, mercury boils at -38\u00b0C. That's pretty cold. However, the higher in elevation you get, the lower the atmospheric pressure. As I mentioned in my previous post, the gas above our sea level atmosphere holds us up. This air (called a vapor) exerts a pressure on the earth below. For example, on top of mount Everest the pressure is one-third of sea level pressure. So if the pressure is lower, that means the air isn't holding us up as much. As the air pressure decreases, the boiling point of liquids decrease as well. The change in temperature is the same for all fluids. If a beaker of water with a known amount of water can be observed to boil at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level, it can be observed to boil around 90 degrees Celsius somewhere like Denver (near the top of the Rocky Mountains), or around 68 degrees Celsius at the summit of Mt. Everest. This holds up for most liquids on Earth.\nThe relationship between temperature and pressure was not an easy one to identify at first. Early observations were plagued by the fact that the gas that was assumed to exert the force on a liquid would push down on the liquid from above. As it turns out, the reason for this mistake was that they were observing the wrong effect. In order to study pressure and temperature, one must first use a tool with which to observe the two. In the case of temperature, it's easy: we have thermometers for that.
