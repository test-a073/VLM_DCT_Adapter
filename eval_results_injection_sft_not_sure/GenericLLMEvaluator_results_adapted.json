As you can see, the dog in this example is the subject of the sentence but is not the agent so it should be cast in the inanimate role. The use of subject in intransitive sentences has been the subject of debate for many decades. This has a double negative, which is equivalent to a positive. It would make the story more interesting but also more complicated so I think it is fine without it. It is not that simple for me. I was trying to use examples from the sentences in the text, but maybe I'll try coming up with ones on my own. I am sure you mean to say: The bird that was killed is a blue jay. Please let me know if those examples work or not. I wonder why these birds are not afraid of this dog, but I can only speculate at this point. But if this is the way of your research, then I'm sure you'll get some good results. You may wish to contact them to see if they have any suggestions. If the eagle didn't kill itself, then someone else (a human) killed it. The dog ate it while walking in the forest. My father who wasn't hit by a vehicle, is named Bob. That was what I was trying to get at. The woman that didn't hit the car is named Mary. They ate it after being thrown in the woods. A good book to understand these grammatical rules is \"The Blue Book\" by Richard D. Russell. When an expression has an inanimate subject, the sentence is considered an inanimate sentence. If all the expressions have an animate subject, then it would be an inanimate sentence. If it had died of natural causes such as old age or disease then it could be considered a predicative death. Some students will have never even heard of a bald eagle before.",

If there is a fever present then the infection is in the bladder. If there is no fever present then it is in the kidneys.\nThe reason for this is that a UTI can easily travel in either direction. So if the bladder is already infected and the virus spreads up to the kidneys which does happen, it may cause kidney pain. Or if the kidneys is not infected at all, but the bladder is and the bacteria grows and spreads. It can then cause kidney infections. This is typically seen in men, as their ureteral tubes which take the urine from the kidney to the bladder are longer, causing infection to spread higher up into the ureters. That is why 90% of all UTIs are seen in women. The bacteria will go into the bladder first and then, if it goes higher up and attacks the upper urinary tract, the patient would have pain in the lower back, and this is more common in men.\nIf you are a male and are presenting these symptoms, the diagnosis would be a urinary tract infection. 60% of UTIs are found in men over 50, and this is more common in men 60 and above.\nIf you are a female, however, presenting to your doctor complaining about lower back pain that travels to the abdomen, accompanied by pelvic pain, and pain during urination as well, you are most likely experiencing a UTI.\nIf it\u2019s a bladder infection, that would be classified as \u201ccystitis.\u201d If it\u2019s a kidney infection, it would be referred to as \u201cPyelonephiritis.\u201d\nTreatment for a UTI is usually an oral antibiotic, unless the patient is extremely sick where an IV antibiotic would be warranted in most cases.

Once everything was hooked up, he asked me to lay still for 5 minutes. Well, I did that. He then got my reading. I asked him to print it out for me. I asked what the numbers meant.

To do that, you'll need to burn off much more calories than you consume every single day. Exercise is one particular way to accomplish that aim. Some people locate that a sensible diet plan supplemented by exercise is beneficial for weight loss.

You could also attempt taking a diet plan supplement that includes natural appetite suppressors. Some over-the-counter medications and supplements contain substances that might enable you lose weight, but the Food and Drug Administration does not manage weight-loss supplements.

You can easily find online calculators to help you with this task.\n\n2. Cut down your calorie intake: To create a calorie deficit, you should aim to eat fewer calories than your body needs to maintain its current weight. There are various ways to reduce calories, including reducing serving sizes, cutting out high-calorie foods like red meat, and increasing your intake of low-calorie foods like fruits and vegetables.\n\n3. Monitor your intake: Keep track of your calorie intake every day with the help of a food diary or app. This will help you to make sure you are staying within your daily calorie limit.\n\nCreating a Calorie Deficit\n\nHere's an example of how to create a calorie deficit:\n\n- If your daily calorie needs are 2000, aim to consume 1500 calories per day.\n- To make it easier, calculate your daily calorie deficit by subtracting your daily calorie needs from your daily calorie limit. For this example, it would be 500 calories (i.e., 2000-1500).\n- Divide this deficit into 6-7 meals a day to make it more manageable.\n- This means that you can consume 250 calories per meal for a total of 1500 calories.\n\nMaintaining a Balanced Diet \n\nA balanced diet should include a variety of foods from all the major food groups: \n\n- Carbohydrates: Whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.\n- Protein: Lean meats, fish, and beans.\n- Fat: Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats found in nuts, seeds, and avocados.\n- Essential nutrients and vitamins: Fresh fruits and vegetables, dairy, whole grains, and lean protein sources.\n\nWhen trying to maintain a balanced diet, here are",

The most important criteria is that it reads EPub.\nKobo are not evil, but they were not on track fast enough, so when they finally did get on track Oprah and Barns & Noble got there first. I think they would have had a fair game against Borders as Borders were pretty clueless and inept, but they were out before they were ever really in.\nAs I understand it, Kobo has a bigger marketshare in Europe. I'm not sure what that means but that might be a good reason to have another look at them.\nMy ebook reader experience has a been a mixed one!\nI went for a Kindle in 2009 when I first heard of them.\nThen I tried the Kobo Glo a couple of years later for travel.\nThen I went for the iPad in 2012 and used it mainly for reading.\nAnd finally I have had the Oasis recently.\nI am currently very happy with the Oasis. I don't tend to borrow books from libraries anymore as they usually only provide Kindle editions, plus I get enough books for free from KU.\nThe Oasis is fantastic to read on, with the one-handed operation, the easy navigation, the larger fonts and the ability to adjust text size (most EPubs do not have the font sizes Kobo has to offer).\nThe Kindle app on iPad for reading is pretty good. I guess that would be a fair comparison. There is a bit of a latency in getting online (compared to iPad reading) and I found the e-ink display to be a little too grey in general (it is also slow to 'wake up' compared to iPad reading). I was expecting it to weigh a lot more than it does and it surprised me a lot when I lifted it up out of the box - it is very light. You do feel like you are flicking through actual pages (and not a screen) and I would say the reading experience is very good, overall.\nI think everyone should have a Kindle or ereader for reading books.

It appears Dell is getting pretty close to delivering the best of both worlds with the new XPS 15.\nWhile Dell hasn't yet announced the price and availability of the new XPS 15, the $1,499 starting price makes this a more affordable option than most other 15-inch laptops that offer touch screens and high-resolution displays. Dell will offer several different configurations, including versions with Intel's powerful new quad-core i5-4300HQ and i7-4700HQ processors, both of which are designed for mainstream desktops and notebooks.\nLike Apple's Retina MacBook Pros, which also feature high-resolution displays, the Dell XPS 15 offers a 15.6-inch full HD touch screen display with a resolution of 3200 x 1800 pixels (208 pixels per inch). As you can see in the image at the top of this post, that means the Dell XPS 15 should have some impressive image and font fidelity even in portrait orientation.\nInside, the Dell XPS 15 features up to 16GB of RAM, support for Intel Iris graphics or discrete Nvidia GeForce GT 750M graphics card, solid state drive storage configurations up to 512GB, and support for up to two USB 3.0, one USB 2.0, one HDMI, one Mini DisplayPort, a media card reader, and a headphone/microphone jack. Like the rest of Dell's XPS laptops, it will also feature a machined aluminum case with an anti-glare finish.\nAt 0.66 inches thick and weighing 4.4 pounds, the Dell XPS 15 isn't the thinnest or lightest 15-inch laptop available, but it's certainly light enough for users on the go to carry it around with them all day long.\nUnlike the MacBook Pro, however, the Dell XPS 15 offers more ports",

If however you plan on using the portable for video editing, gaming, or perhaps just plain old work applications then I\u2019d recommend the Dell XPS 15z. If you are primarily a web surfer then this is a great option for you. The specs include a large 16 inch screen \u2014 1366 x 768 pixels to be exact \u2014 and Windows XP. It might sound weird to recommend a computer with a small hard drive, but this has the added bonus of making it very small and portable, especially considering the size of the screen. There\u2019s a 1.5 GHz Atom Z520 processor, 1 Gb of RAM and an integrated Intel GMA950 graphics card. This is a real all in one device and is highly portable and easy to use. It would be perfect for any casual computer user. You aren\u2019t going to have the processing power to play a lot of games on it or put a ton of apps on it, but for Facebook, web surfing, watching videos and light email it is an excellent option. It is available directly from Acer, but it can also be found at Best Buy or several other online retailers. It\u2019s an excellent bargain priced at just $449. If you\u2019re a parent you\u2019ll probably appreciate the Acer and the Dell because with the Acer it is incredibly durable and very difficult to damage.
