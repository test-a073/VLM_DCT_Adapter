But, if you were to ask me about my ideal autumn getaway, here's a list of places where I would love to spend my fall days...\n\nTable of Contents\n\n## #1. Harbin, China, for ice and snow festival\n\nAutumn comes to life late in Harbin, China. Mostly known for the winter ice and snow festival and cold winters, I would actually prefer visiting here during fall. In autumn, Harbin transforms into a multi-colored town with beautiful leaves, making it the perfect time for photographers. This is indeed an off-beat pick, but I've always been intrigued by the idea of experiencing autumn in a place that doesn't usually get much attention during this season.\n\nAutumn in Harbin offers incredible scenic beauty\n\n## #2. Kyoto, Japan, for autumn foliage\n\nJapan in autumn is a spectacular sight, and Kyoto is an absolute must-visit destination. Known for its beautiful Japanese gardens, temples, and shrines, the city is a riot of colors during autumn. The most famous spots to view autumn foliage in Kyoto are Fushimi Inari, Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, and Sagano Romantic Train.\n\nKyoto\u2019s Arashiyama district in the autumn foliage season\n\n## #3. Toronto, Canada, for Cineplex film festivals\n\nIf I were to pick a more urban destination for an autumn getaway, it would definitely be Toronto in Canada. The city comes alive with festivals during the fall, and Cineplex film festivals are one of my favorite ones. With an incredible lineup of international and national films, I always make sure I attend the Toronto International Film Festival before the autumn season ends.\n\n## #4. Quebec City, Canada, for the fall colors and festivals\n\nQuebec City is my go-to destination for a perfect autumn getaway. With its stunning fall foliage scene and the many festivals the city hosts, I've always had a great time visiting Quebec City during autumn. Some of the popular autumn festivals here include Quebec International Film Festival, Festival de la chanson de Granby, and Qu\u00e9bec City-Chute Mont-Royal.\n\nA lovely autumn day in",
