For example, in Terminator 2, the Terminator kills Sara Underwood so that John would be more motivated to kill him and not lose his edge.\n\nIs this a common trope, or just some writers not being able to pull the trigger?\n\nThis is a common trope indeed. You've referred to several examples, including John Connor's mother from the Terminator films, but there are many more: James Bond's parents, for instance, in the book Moonraker by Ian Fleming, and in the film GoldenEye; the parents of Harry Potter (but not his aunt and uncle), in the Harry Potter series; the parents of Luke Skywalker in Star Wars, and so on. In fact, this trope is so common that it has a name: the \"dead parents\" clich\u00e9. It's a staple of many movies and books.\n\nThis trope is used to motivate the protagonist and to create a sense of tragedy and victimhood. It makes the audience feel sympathy for the protagonist and often puts them on the protagonist's side, rooting for them to seek revenge and justice. The death of a parent or close family member is a powerful emotional event that can leave a deep impact on a person, making them stronger and more determined.\n\nHowever, as you've suggested, some writers might use this trope not because it's a good storytelling device but because they're not confident in their ability to kill off important characters. It's a way to have the emotional impact of a death without actually having to go through with it. This might be a cynical perspective, but it's a possibility. Ultimately, it's up to the writer to use the trope effectively and in a way that serves the story.",

A SKILLET, of course!\n\nNow if you\u2019re like me, who enjoys playing around in the kitchen to create delicious and easy meals, then you know the value of a versatile and high-quality skillet. But with so many choices out there, how do you pick the one that suits your needs and lifestyle best?\n\nWell, fear not, dear reader! I\u2019ve got you covered. In this article, we\u2019ll be diving into the world of skillets and exploring the various types, materials, sizes, and features that can help you make an informed decision when it comes to selecting the perfect skillet for your kitchen.\n\n## Types of Skillets\n\n### 1. Cast Iron Skillets\n\nCast iron skillets are the classic choice for any home cook. They are known for their durability, even heat distribution, and versatility. These skillets can be used on the stovetop or in the oven, and they can even be used over a campfire.\n\nCast iron skillets are typically seasoned with a thin layer of oil to create a non-stick surface. With proper seasoning and care, a cast iron skillet can last for generations.\n\n### 2. Stainless Steel Skillets\n\nStainless steel skillets are a popular choice due to their resistance to corrosion, durability, and ease of cleaning. They are also fairly lightweight compared to cast iron skillets. Stainless steel skillets are generally more expensive, but they offer even heat distribution and a uniform cooking surface.\n\n### 3. Non-Stick Skillets\n\nNon-stick skillets, as the name suggests, have a surface coated with a material that prevents food from sticking to the pan. This makes them great for cooking delicate foods like eggs and pancakes.\n\nNon-stick skillets are usually lighter in weight and easier to clean than cast iron or stainless steel skillets. However, they are not as durable and may need to be replaced more frequently.\n\n### 4. Ceramic Skillets\n\nCeramic skillets offer the benefits of non-stick skillets without the potential health concerns of Teflon or other non-stick coatings. Cer",

Water the bulbs well after planting and keep the soil moist during the growing season. Cut back the dead foliage once it turns yellow in the summer.

Protect the bulbs from squirrels and other digging animals by covering them with a layer of mulch or netting. Daffodils are also toxic to some animals, so keep them away from pets and livestock.\n\nHarvesting daffodils: Daffodils are not typically harvested for food or medicinal purposes. The bulbs are sometimes used for decoration or to make perfume, but it is important to note that daffodil bulbs are toxic and can cause illness or death if ingested. It is best to leave the bulbs in the ground and enjoy the flowers as they bloom.\n\nBenefits of daffodils: Daffodils are known for their beautiful blooms, but they also have several other benefits. They are a great addition to any garden, as they add color and brightness during the spring season. Daffodils are also helpful in attracting pollinators, such as bees and butterflies, which can help support the ecosystem.

Amoxicillin is considered a relatively low-risk antibiotic in this regard, but it still carries some risk, especially if used for prolonged periods or in young children with developing teeth.\n\nSo while your current prescription for amoxicillin is not directly related to my claim, it does highlight the importance of being aware of the potential risks of antibiotics on dental health, especially in young children and pregnant women. It's always best to discuss any concerns with your healthcare provider and to follow their instructions for proper use of any prescribed medication.",

When the crash happened he supposedly went to his friends the bankers in Chicago to ask for help. They gave him a sum of money, supposedly a multi-million dollar loan that was enough to tide him over, so he wouldn't become bankrupt, so he could continue his political career. But I'm really interested in whether that loan was forgiven-- was it really paid back?-- or, did he give it back with interest? I've heard contradictory information on the matter.

Thanks for any help you can provide on these topics!\n\nFirst, let's clarify some facts about the presidents you mentioned and their roles during the Great Depression.\n\n1. Hoover's Background and the Beginning of the Depression: Herbert Hoover became the 31st President of the United States on March 4, 1929. Before his presidency, Hoover had a successful career as a businessman, particularly in mining and engineering, but he did not work directly as a banker in Chicago. During the 1920s, the U.S. economy experienced a period of prosperity, with stock market speculation and inflation driving significant economic expansion. However, the unsustainable condition of the economy came to a head in October 1929, when the stock market crashed. The crash marked the beginning of the Great Depression.\n\n2. Hoover and the Depression: Hoover, a known advocate of laissez-faire economics, was initially reluctant to intervene in the economy during the Depression.

That's the date of the last known Mayan inscription found at Palenque in southern Mexico.\n\nAfter that, Maya culture slowly fused with European culture, became Spanish, Mexican, and so forth. Many millions of Maya live in Central America and Mexico even today.

No Mayan civilization has ever built a pyramid in the last 500 years. It's not really Mayan art, or music, or poetry, or anything recognizably Mayan except the blood.\n\nThe reason we link the end date with calendars is because the Maya used the Long Count calendar, which ended on what we call Dec. 21, 2012. But there's nothing in the texts that suggests this marked an \"end\" in the sense we understand today. It was just a long cycle being closed and a new one starting.\n\nIt's important to note that the Maya used *multiple* calendars at the same time. The Long Count was one of many. The Haab was another, which determined what the current year sign was. And there was a shorter calendar, the Tzolk'in, that determined the current day sign. The Tzolk'in and Haab calendars were 260 days long, which is why we have those numbers attached to the supposed \"end\" date. Each day of the Tzolk'in has a name, but each year starts over with the same name, and they're cycled through 26 times to get a 52-year cycle. So if the end cycle starts with 1 Imix (the snake in the hand glyph), that means the first day of the next cycle, also a 1 Imix, will be the same day--just repeated in a different cycle.\n\nSo, in answer to your question, the Mayan civilization didn't actually end on Dec. 21, 2012.

He also made a lot of reforms including legalizing and writing down Chinese laws and replacing the brutal forms of punishment with more humane measures. He also set up the central imperial bureaucracy and the civil service exams so that anyone could reach high positions in government if they had the talents and abilities regardless of their aristocracy background.\n\nBy doing all these things, he not only created a stable and powerful China but also laid the foundation for China as a great civilization that lasted for thousands of years.

It also has an atmospheric composition that's similar to Earth's, with an abundance of water vapor at all altitudes.\n\nAstronomers have discovered some planets outside our solar system that fit these criteria from observations of their transit signals and spectroscopic analysis, such as Kepler-425b (formerly KOI-961.01). What information might we hope to learn about this planet by observing it? What sort of telescopes or observatories might be best suited for such observations?\n\nOne thing we might hope to learn is the amount and distribution of liquid water on the surface of the planet. We could possibly infer this from the reflectivity of the planet's surface (ice and water reflect sunlight differently), or from the spectral signatures of water in the planet's atmosphere. We would also be interested in detecting signs of life\u2014for example, oxygen in the atmosphere or biochemical signatures.\n\nTo make these observations, we might turn to a combination of ground-based observatories and space-based telescopes. Ground-based observatories with large apertures, such as the Gran Telescopio Canarias or the Very Large Telescope, could be used to observe the planet's reflectivity and to search for spectral signatures of water and potential biomarkers. Space-based telescopes with high sensitivity and resolution, such as the James Webb Space Telescope or the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope, would be ideal for studying the planet's atmosphere and searching for signs of life.\n\nIt's also worth noting that observing a planet like this indirectly, through its transit signal or reflectivity, may not give us a complete picture of its surface and atmospheric conditions. To get a more detailed understanding, we might consider sending a space probe to the planet. Such a mission would be a significant technological challenge, but it could provide unprecedented insights into the planet's composition and potential habitability.",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a document titled \u201cStrategies for Engineered Control for Prevention and Reduction of Airborne Infection in Health Care Facilities: Guideline.\u201d This document primarily deals with airborne diseases as spread within health care facilities and the infection-control strategies for such facilities. However, many of the concepts are applicable to nonhealth care facilities.\n\nHere are some interesting points from the document:\n\n- Airborne microorganisms enter an HVAC system with all other air and therefore HVAC maintenance can affect airborne infection-control strategies. For example, when air filters are changed, there is the potential for significant dispersion of microorganisms.\n- Negative air pressure rooms are recommended to minimize the spread of infectious droplet nuclei.\n- UVGI (ultraviolet germicidal irradiation) in the ventilation system can aid in reducing microorganisms.\n- High-efficiency particulate arrestors (HEPA) in the HVAC system need to be installed or used to capture at least 99.97% of particles 0.3 microns in size.\n- Humidity and temperature affect the size and survival of airborne droplet nuclei.\n- Fans and jets for producing white noise and patient comfort should not be placed within 1 meter (3 feet) of the supply air grille.\n\nOverall, HVAC plays a significant role in the prevention and reduction of airborne infection in facilities that can harbor such diseases. This can be especially true in schools, particularly day cares, where large numbers of people are in close proximity. A more detailed review of the CDC document is recommended for those interested in more information about preventing airborne infections in nonhealth care facilities.

However, it lacks specificity as it doesn't ask the user what software they want to upgrade. The assistant assumes the user is a customer of a specific software, which may not be the case. The reference answer indicates that the user might be referring to an iPhone software upgrade, which the assistant's response doesn't cover. Therefore, the response, while generally informative, is not entirely relevant to the user's question. The assistant should have asked for more information to provide a more accurate response. \n\n6.5"

        "model_prediction": "How do you tell they need changing?\n\nI don't see any physical damage or discoloration, but the \"white\" in the background is starting to look more gray to the naked eye. And when I test the color balance with a neutral target, I see a definite shift toward the magenta end of the spectrum.\n\nThis is likely due to UV degradation, which can change the color balance, reduce contrast, and even cause the film to curl or bubble. The plastic itself may also degrade over time, possibly becoming brittle or more susceptible to moisture damage (assuming you keep your film in temperature-controlled environments).\n\nThe exact time frame for how long a roll of film can last before it starts to show noticeable signs of degradation can depend on a variety of factors, including storage conditions, the type of film, and even the specific batch or manufacturing date. However, if you've had your film for several years and you're concerned about its condition, it may be a good idea to consider scanning it and making digital backups to ensure you have the best possible copies of your images for posterity.\n\nIf you want to try and extend the life of your film, there are a few things you can do:\n\n1. Store it in cool, dry conditions away from sunlight and extreme temperature fluctuations. Film should ideally be stored in a climate-controlled environment at a steady temperature between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit (10-21 degrees Celsius).\n2. Use archival-quality storage cases, film reels, or canisters that have been specifically designed to keep film fresh for longer periods of time.\n3. Handle your film carefully when loading and unloading it from cameras, making sure to avoid touching the emulsion with your fingers as much as possible.\n4. Process your film as soon as possible after taking the images, as prolonged exposure to light and other environmental factors can contribute to degradation.\n5. Consider making digital backups of your images as soon as you scan or develop them, to provide an extra layer of protection against potential future degradation or loss.",

        "model_prediction": "For portraits, a prime lens with a focal length between 85mm and 135mm would be ideal. This range allows for a moderate compression of the subject's features, creating a pleasing and flattering image. Two popular options from Canon are the Canon EF 85mm f/1.4L IS USM and the Canon EF 135mm f/2L USM. Both lenses offer excellent image quality, a bright aperture for shallow depth of field, and image stabilization for handheld shooting. Other brands like Nikon and Sony have similar options in this focal length range. For a more budget-friendly alternative, a 50mm f/1.8 lens can also be used, which provides a natural perspective and a wide aperture for nice bokeh. However, keep in mind that lenses in the 85mm-135mm range offer more flattering perspectives for portraits.",
