For example, in Terminator 2, the Terminator kills Sara Underwood so that John would be more motivated to kill him and not lose his edge.\n\nIs this a common trope, or just some writers not being able to pull the trigger?\n\nThis is a common trope indeed. You've referred to several examples, including John Connor's mother from the Terminator films, but there are many more: James Bond's parents, for instance, in the book Moonraker by Ian Fleming, and in the film GoldenEye; the parents of Harry Potter (but not his aunt and uncle), in the Harry Potter series; the parents of Luke Skywalker in Star Wars, and so on. In fact, this trope is so common that it has a name: the \"dead parents\" clich\u00e9. It's a staple of many movies and books.\n\nThis trope is used to motivate the protagonist and to create a sense of tragedy and victimhood. It makes the audience feel sympathy for the protagonist and often puts them on the protagonist's side, rooting for them to seek revenge and justice. The death of a parent or close family member is a powerful emotional event that can leave a deep impact on a person, making them stronger and more determined.\n\nHowever, as you've suggested, some writers might use this trope not because it's a good storytelling device but because they're not confident in their ability to kill off important characters.

A SKILLET, of course!\n\nNow if you\u2019re like me, who enjoys playing around in the kitchen to create delicious and easy meals, then you know the value of a versatile and high-quality skillet. But with so many choices out there, how do you pick the one that suits your needs and lifestyle best?\n\nWell, fear not, dear reader! I\u2019ve got you covered. In this article, we\u2019ll be diving into the world of skillets and exploring the various types, materials, sizes, and features that can help you make an informed decision when it comes to selecting the perfect skillet for your kitchen.\n\n## Types of Skillets\n\n### 1. Cast Iron Skillets\n\nCast iron skillets are the classic choice for any home cook. They are known for their durability, even heat distribution, and versatility. These skillets can be used on the stovetop or in the oven, and they can even be used over a campfire.\n\nCast iron skillets are typically seasoned with a thin layer of oil to create a non-stick surface. With proper seasoning and care, a cast iron skillet can last for generations.\n\n### 2. Stainless Steel Skillets\n\nStainless steel skillets are a popular choice due to their resistance to corrosion, durability, and ease of cleaning. They are also fairly lightweight compared to cast iron skillets. Stainless steel skillets are generally more expensive, but they offer even heat distribution and a uniform cooking surface.\n\n### 3. Non-Stick Skillets\n\nNon-stick skillets, as the name suggests, have a surface coated with a material that prevents food from sticking to the pan. This makes them great for cooking delicate foods like eggs and pancakes.\n\nNon-stick skillets are usually lighter in weight and easier to clean than cast iron or stainless steel skillets. However, they are not as durable and may need to be replaced more frequently.\n\n### 4. Ceramic Skillets\n\nCeramic skillets offer the benefits of non-stick skillets without the potential health concerns of Teflon or other non-stick coatings.

Thanks for any help you can provide on these topics!\n\nFirst, let's clarify some facts about the presidents you mentioned and their roles during the Great Depression.\n\n1. Hoover's Background and the Beginning of the Depression: Herbert Hoover became the 31st President of the United States on March 4, 1929. Before his presidency, Hoover had a successful career as a businessman, particularly in mining and engineering, but he did not work directly as a banker in Chicago. During the 1920s, the U.S. economy experienced a period of prosperity, with stock market speculation and inflation driving significant economic expansion. However, the unsustainable condition of the economy came to a head in October 1929, when the stock market crashed. The crash marked the beginning of the Great Depression.\n\n2.

That's the date of the last known Mayan inscription found at Palenque in southern Mexico.\n\nAfter that, Maya culture slowly fused with European culture, became Spanish, Mexican, and so forth. Many millions of Maya live in Central America and Mexico even today. But the \"Mayan\" civilization we associate with big pyramids, the calendar, hieroglyphs, and so forth--that part of it just wasn't around any more. No Mayan civilization has ever built a pyramid in the last 500 years. It's not really Mayan art, or music, or poetry, or anything recognizably Mayan except the blood.\n\nThe reason we link the end date with calendars is because the Maya used the Long Count calendar, which ended on what we call Dec. 21, 2012. But there's nothing in the texts that suggests this marked an \"end\" in the sense we understand today. It was just a long cycle being closed and a new one starting.\n\nIt's important to note that the Maya used *multiple* calendars at the same time. The Long Count was one of many. The Haab was another, which determined what the current year sign was. And there was a shorter calendar, the Tzolk'in, that determined the current day sign. The Tzolk'in and Haab calendars were 260 days long, which is why we have those numbers attached to the supposed \"end\" date. Each day of the Tzolk'in has a name, but each year starts over with the same name, and they're cycled through 26 times to get a 52-year cycle. So if the end cycle starts with 1 Imix (the snake in the hand glyph), that means the first day of the next cycle, also a 1 Imix, will be the same day--just repeated in a different cycle.\n\nSo, in answer to your question, the Mayan civilization didn't actually end on Dec. 21, 2012.

He also made a lot of reforms including legalizing and writing down Chinese laws and replacing the brutal forms of punishment with more humane measures. He also set up the central imperial bureaucracy and the civil service exams so that anyone could reach high positions in government if they had the talents and abilities regardless of their aristocracy background.\n\nBy doing all these things, he not only created a stable and powerful China but also laid the foundation for China as a great civilization that lasted for thousands of years.

For example, Julius Caesar and Napoleon Bonaparte who brought great changes to the world weren't nice people either.\n\nAs for Confucianism, it certainly had a huge impact on the Chinese civilization but its impact started much earlier than the Qin dynasty. Confucianism was the philosophy of the old feudal society and its primary concern was promoting harmony and morality in human relationship.

It influenced the way people saw their roles in society and how they should behave in their personal and public lives. It also provided the moral foundation for the new Chinese bureaucracy.

It also has an atmospheric composition that's similar to Earth's, with an abundance of water vapor at all altitudes.\n\nAstronomers have discovered some planets outside our solar system that fit these criteria from observations of their transit signals and spectroscopic analysis, such as Kepler-425b (formerly KOI-961.01). What information might we hope to learn about this planet by observing it? What sort of telescopes or observatories might be best suited for such observations?\n\nOne thing we might hope to learn is the amount and distribution of liquid water on the surface of the planet. We could possibly infer this from the reflectivity of the planet's surface (ice and water reflect sunlight differently), or from the spectral signatures of water in the planet's atmosphere. We would also be interested in detecting signs of life\u2014for example, oxygen in the atmosphere or biochemical signatures.\n\nTo make these observations, we might turn to a combination of ground-based observatories and space-based telescopes. Ground-based observatories with large apertures, such as the Gran Telescopio Canarias or the Very Large Telescope, could be used to observe the planet's reflectivity and to search for spectral signatures of water and potential biomarkers. Space-based telescopes with high sensitivity and resolution, such as the James Webb Space Telescope or the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope, would be ideal for studying the planet's atmosphere and searching for signs of life.\n\nIt's also worth noting that observing a planet like this indirectly, through its transit signal or reflectivity, may not give us a complete picture of its surface and atmospheric conditions.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a document titled \u201cStrategies for Engineered Control for Prevention and Reduction of Airborne Infection in Health Care Facilities: Guideline.\u201d This document primarily deals with airborne diseases as spread within health care facilities and the infection-control strategies for such facilities. However, many of the concepts are applicable to nonhealth care facilities.\n\nHere are some interesting points from the document:\n\n- Airborne microorganisms enter an HVAC system with all other air and therefore HVAC maintenance can affect airborne infection-control strategies. For example, when air filters are changed, there is the potential for significant dispersion of microorganisms.\n- Negative air pressure rooms are recommended to minimize the spread of infectious droplet nuclei.\n- UVGI (ultraviolet germicidal irradiation) in the ventilation system can aid in reducing microorganisms.\n- High-efficiency particulate arrestors (HEPA) in the HVAC system need to be installed or used to capture at least 99.97% of particles 0.3 microns in size.\n- Humidity and temperature affect the size and survival of airborne droplet nuclei.\n- Fans and jets for producing white noise and patient comfort should not be placed within 1 meter (3 feet) of the supply air grille.\n\nOverall, HVAC plays a significant role in the prevention and reduction of airborne infection in facilities that can harbor such diseases. This can be especially true in schools, particularly day cares, where large numbers of people are in close proximity.

{"id": 100, "task_category": "N/A", "model_input": "Yes, please include information on a suitable lens for portraits as well.", "prediction": "For portraits, a prime lens with a focal length between 85mm and 135mm would be ideal. This range allows for a moderate compression of the subject's features, creating a pleasing and flattering image. Two popular options from Canon are the Canon EF 85mm f/1.4L IS USM and the Canon EF 135mm f/2L USM. Both lenses offer excellent image quality, a bright aperture for shallow depth of field, and image stabilization for handheld shooting. Other brands like Nikon and Sony have similar options in this focal length range. For a more budget-friendly alternative, a 50mm f/1.8 lens can also be used, which provides a natural perspective and a wide aperture for nice bokeh. However, keep in mind that lenses in the 85mm-135mm range offer more flattering perspectives for portraits.", "reference_answer": "Absolutely, I will include options for a beginner-friendly digital camera and a portrait lens within your budget.
